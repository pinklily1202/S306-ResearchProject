    "The dataset \"Student Performance\" created by Paulo Cortez and Alice Silva was collected during the 2005-2006 school year from the public schools Gabriel Pereira and Mousinho da Silveira in Portugal, consisting of 395 observations. In total, there are 32 explanatory variables and the response variable: the final grade of a participant in Mathematics. It has both continuous and categorical attributes and addresses classification tasks.\n",
